<h1 align="center"><strong>Movie app (React + Vite + Redux workshop)</strong></h1>

## Description

This is a movie management application built with React, Vite, and Redux, developed as part of a React/Redux course.
The app integrates with the OMDB API to fetch movie data, allowing users to search for movies, add them to a "To Watch" list, and mark them as watched.
The state management is powered by Redux, utilizing slices and redux-persist to maintain user data across sessions, while react-bootstrap is used for styling.
